Lab 6 : Node.js and Pystache 

I downloaded and installed node.js and pystache and ran the corresponding commands. 

Node.js was used to run several JavaScript files including hello-world.js
![hello js](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8ef393-5e7c-46d9-b256-71b4f0550a8b)

Node.ja then ran a hello.js file and displayed a message every time it was ran 
![hellonotworld js](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b6826b-0c4b-45d4-8316-a34dbc9e4d43)

The third file was run and displayed the number of times the page was refreshed

Pystache was installed to run a test script called say_hello.py to print from a list several strings with "Hey."
