Lab 1: GHDL and GTKWave 

The instructions were to go to the repository for Digital System Design and navigate to the GHDL folder, then to install GHDL and GTKWave. Then to run the half adder and another example of my choice and document the results here.

In this lab, I learned how to install and use both GHDL and GTKWave, both of which are tools used for simulation and debugging of circuits. GHDL is a compiler that is used to translate VHDL files into machine code, whereas GTKWave is a tool for visualizing circuit behaviors. Both of these tools can be used to help design hardware, perform tests, and verify any digital systems.
