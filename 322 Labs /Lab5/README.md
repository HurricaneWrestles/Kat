Lab 5: Paho - MQTT 

In this lab, I was instructed to go to the the GitHub repository and review Lesson 5, then to install Paho-MQTT. I changed directories to the iot repository and updated the repository with git pull, then changed directories to lesson5 and ran python subcpu.py on one terminal and python pubcpu.py on another terminal. The results are documented below. 

I already had python and Paho-MQTT installed, and then I set up the two terminals by using the commands below: 
* cd ~/iot
* git pull
* cd lesson5

Results After RUnning Each:

This image shows the data my terminal gave me related to my CPU from running the commands, and the terminal running the subcpu.py shows the printed data coming from the pubcpu.py terminal. 

I learned how to use Paho-MQTT to publish messages from the terminal and how to subscribe one temrinal to another terminal.
